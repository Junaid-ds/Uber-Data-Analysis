# Uber-Data-Analysis
Project Overview: Uber Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to ride usage. The notebook includes the following key sections:

1. Data Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods like data.info() and data.shape are used to understand the structure of the dataset.
Missing values in the "PURPOSE" column are filled with 'NOT' to handle null entries.
2. Data Visualization
Libraries like matplotlib and seaborn are used for visual representation.
Various types of plots are likely used to explore trends in trip purpose, time-based usage, and location-based insights.
The project likely aims to analyze Uber trip data for business insights, user behavior, or transportation patterns. If you need a deeper breakdown, please upload the dataset (UberDataset.csv).
